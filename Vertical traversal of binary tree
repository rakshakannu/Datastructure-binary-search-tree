// starting from left side we need to print all the nodes with the condition that they fall in the same vertical line
// we use the concept of horizontal distance, keeping the root at 0 and incerementing and decrementing on the left and the right side
// we need to take care of order of the nodes, and if two nodes are overlapping, the left child should be given preference

idea:
we want to maintain nodes in sorted order of horizontal distance
1. create an empty map (Treemap in java)
map is a self balancing binary search tree, that maintains key-value pairs, and the items are sorted according to the keys. we use horizontal distnace as the key into this map, and
we use array of nodes as the values into the treemap. to fill this map, we use level order traversal.
(int key, array values)

2. do level order traversal and put the values into the map

3. now traverse the map and print the contents
