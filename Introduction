// based on binary search algorithm
// for every node, keys on left are smaller and keys on right are greater
// all keys are typically considered as distinct
// like linked list, it is a linked data structure
// in c++ it is implemented as map, set, multiset, multimap. in java it is implemented using TreeSet and TreeMap.
// binary search trees are represented same as binary trees
// same int key, left and right references.
// order has to be maintained while deleting an item
